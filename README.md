# Welcome to my first OpenAI API project

This project uses the OpenAI API to generate detailed recipes with ingredients, preparation steps, and cooking instructions. Simply enter a dish name, and the AI agent will provide a complete recipe.

**Key capabilities**:

Connects to OpenAI's powerful GPT models (GPT-4o by default)
Securely stores API keys using environment variables
Generates structured, easy-to-follow recipes
Simple Python interface

## Prerequisites

- Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended)
- `pip` (comes with Python)
- An [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) with an API key
- [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to store the OpenAI API key from a `.env` file

## Installation
